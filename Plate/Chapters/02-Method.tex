\section{Search Strategy}

A comprehensive literature search was conducted between December 2023 and January 2024 across PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases. Search terms combined MeSH headings and text words related to burn injury (burns, thermal injury, burn wound), multidisciplinary care (interdisciplinary, team-based, coordinated care), and Australasian settings (Australia, New Zealand, ANZBA, BRANZ).

\section{Selection Criteria}

\subsection{Inclusion Criteria}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Studies from Australasian burn units published 2014-2024
    \item Adult and/or pediatric burn populations
    \item Comparison of multidisciplinary versus single-discipline approaches or evaluation of multidisciplinary interventions
    \item Clinical outcomes including mortality, length of stay, complications, or functional measures
    \item Level 2b evidence or higher
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Exclusion Criteria}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Non-Australasian studies
    \item Case reports or opinion pieces
    \item Studies focusing solely on single interventions without team coordination
    \item Conference abstracts without full publication
\end{enumerate}
