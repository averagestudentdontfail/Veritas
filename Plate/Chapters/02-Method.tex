\section{Search Strategy}

A comprehensive literature search was conducted between December 2023 and February 2025 across PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases. Search terms combined Medical Subject Headings (\gls{mesh}) and text words related to burn injury (burns, thermal injury, burn wound, scald), multidisciplinary care (interdisciplinary, team-based, coordinated care, collaborative management), and Australasian settings (Australia, New Zealand, ANZBA, BRANZ, Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander, MÄori, Pacific Islander).
