\chapter*{Abstract}
**Background:** Acute burn injury represents one of the most complex medical emergencies, requiring coordinated intervention across multiple healthcare disciplines. While \gls{multidisciplinary} approaches have become standard in Australasian \glspl{burnunit} since the early 2000s, the empirical evidence base comparing these models to traditional single-discipline care requires careful evaluation.
**Objective:** To critically appraise current Australasian evidence examining whether coordinated \gls{multidisciplinary} management improves clinical outcomes compared to traditional single-discipline-led care in adults and children with acute burn injury.
**Methods:** Comprehensive literature search following \gls{prisma} guidelines across PubMed, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and \gls{branz} publications (January 2014-February 2025). Search strategy identified 287 articles, with 184 screened after duplicate removal, 76 full-text articles assessed, and 43 meeting inclusion criteria. Evidence synthesis focused on 15 highest-quality studies, with assessment based on Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine criteria.
**Results:** No studies directly compared \gls{multidisciplinary} versus traditional single-discipline care, as \gls{mdt} management has become universal standard practice across all 17 Australasian \glspl{burnunit}. Registry data from 31,498 patients demonstrates that units with comprehensive \gls{mdt} protocols achieve superior outcomes: 97\% of patients receive allied health assessment within 48 hours, functional independence scores improve by 35-40\%, and long-term \gls{qol} measures show sustained benefits. Implementation studies confirm feasibility across diverse settings including remote communities via \gls{telehealth}. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations show particular benefit when \gls{culturalsafety} principles integrate within \gls{mdt} frameworks.
**Conclusions:** While direct comparative evidence is absent due to universal \gls{mdt} adoption, convergent evidence from registry analyses, quality improvement studies, and implementation research strongly supports coordinated \gls{multidisciplinary} management as optimal care standard for acute burn injury. The absence of contemporary single-discipline comparators paradoxically validates \gls{mdt} effectiveness through its complete acceptance across Australasian burn services.

# Introduction

## Clinical Scenario
A 42-year-old construction worker presents to the emergency department following a workplace accident involving hot bitumen, sustaining burns to 35\% total body surface area (TBSA) affecting his chest, abdomen, and both arms. TBSA represents the percentage of body surface affected by burns, typically calculated using either the "Rule of Nines" (dividing body surface into sections representing 9\% or multiples thereof) or more precise Lund and Browder charts that account for age-related body proportions. The severity of his injuries necessitates admission to a specialized burn unit where the complexity of his care becomes immediately apparent. Beyond critical fluid resuscitation using the Parkland Formula (4mL/kg/\% TBSA of crystalloid over 24 hours), he requires multimodal pain management, early mobilization to prevent contractures, nutritional support exceeding 30 kcal/kg/day, psychological assistance for acute stress symptoms, and coordination with his family struggling to understand the lengthy recovery ahead.
The burn unit team faces a fundamental question: will coordinated multidisciplinary care involving burn surgeons, intensivists, nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, dietitians, psychologists, and social workers produce better outcomes than traditional sequential consultation models where each discipline operates independently? This scenario, replicated thousands of times annually across Australasian \glspl{burnunit}, illustrates why burn injury represents one of medicine's most complex management challenges.

## Background

### The Australasian Burn Care Context
Burn injury affects approximately 6,000-7,000 Australians and New Zealanders requiring hospitalization annually, with severe burns (defined as greater than 20\% TBSA or requiring intensive care admission) comprising 15\% of these admissions. The \gls{branz}, established in 2009, systematically collects standardized clinical data from 17 specialist \glspl{burnunit} across both countries, creating one of the world's most comprehensive burn care quality monitoring systems. This infrastructure enables rigorous evaluation of different care models, revealing significant variations in practice patterns and clinical outcomes between centers despite standardized treatment protocols.
\clearpage
The \gls{anzba} coordinates evidence-based practice standards across the region, establishing minimum criteria for designated burn centers including 24-hour specialized nursing, immediate surgical availability, and access to allied health services. However, the organization and integration of these services varies considerably between institutions, from traditional hierarchical models to fully integrated team-based approaches.

### Defining Multidisciplinary Burn Care
Multidisplinary care in burn care extends beyond simple co-location of different healthcare specialists. True multidisciplinary care, as defined by ANZBA guidelines, requires five essential components: (1) regular structured team meetings with representation from all disciplines, (2) unified documentation systems enabling real-time information sharing, (3) coordinated goal-setting involving patients and families, (4) shared decision-making protocols for major clinical decisions, and (5) systematic quality improvement processes with multidisciplinary participation.
This contrasts with traditional models where burn surgeons or intensivists direct medical management while other disciplines provide supplementary services upon request. In traditional models, a physiotherapist might see a patient only after surgical procedures are complete, whereas multidisciplinary models involve physiotherapy from admission in surgical planning to optimize functional outcomes. The fundamental question becomes whether the additional resources required for coordinated multidisciplinary care produce sufficient improvements in patient outcomes to justify increased operational complexity and cost.

## Focused Clinical Question
In adult and paediatric patients with acute burn injury requiring specialist burn unit admission, does coordinated multidisciplinary team management, compared with traditional single-discipline-led care with sequential consultations, improve clinical outcomes including survival, length of stay, functional recovery, and quality of life?

# Methods

## Search Strategy
A comprehensive review following \gls{prisma} guidelines was conducted between June 2025, and August 2025. The search strategy aimed to identify all relevant Australasian studies comparing \gls{multidisciplinary} versus traditional burn care models or evaluating \gls{mdt} implementation with historical controls.

### Database Search
Primary databases searched included PubMed/MEDLINE (2014-2025), CINAHL Complete (2014-2025), Cochrane Library including Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, EMBASE (2014-2025), and the \gls{branz} publications database. Secondary sources included Australian Indigenous HealthInfoNet, Google Scholar (first 200 results), reference lists of included studies, \gls{anzba} conference proceedings, and institutional repositories of major burn centers.
Search terms were combined using Boolean operators:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Population: (burn* OR "thermal injury" OR scald*) AND (Australia* OR "New Zealand" OR ANZBA OR BRANZ)
    \item Intervention: (multidisciplinary OR interdisciplinary OR "team-based" OR "coordinated care" OR "collaborative management")
    \item Comparison: (traditional OR "single discipline" OR sequential OR "usual care")
    \item Outcomes: (mortality OR survival OR "length of stay" OR function* OR "quality of life" OR recovery)
\end{itemize}
\clearpage

# Evidence Synthesis

## Overview of Evidence Landscape
The comprehensive review reveals a fundamental characteristic of contemporary Australasian burn care: \gls{multidisciplinary} management has become so universally accepted that no recent studies compare it with traditional single-discipline models. This complete paradigm shift, while validating \gls{mdt} effectiveness through universal adoption, creates challenges for evidence-based evaluation. The 15 selected studies therefore provide convergent rather than comparative evidence, examining \gls{mdt} implementation quality, outcome variations, and optimization strategies rather than questioning the fundamental approach.

## Critical Appraisal of Evidence

### Registry-Based Population Evidence
The most comprehensive evidence emerges from \gls{branz} registry analyses encompassing over 31,000 burn admissions. \textcite{Cleland2016} established baseline understanding by documenting that all participating units employ \glspl{mdt}, though with varying implementation completeness. Units with comprehensive \gls{mdt} protocols (daily rounds, unified documentation, formal communication structures) demonstrated superior risk-adjusted outcomes compared to units with less developed team integration.
\textcite{Gong2021} advanced this foundation by developing 23 evidence-based quality indicators for \gls{multidisciplinary} burn care through systematic review and Delphi consensus. These indicators span structure (team composition, meeting frequency), process (assessment timing, communication protocols), and outcome measures (functional recovery, patient satisfaction). Analysis of 31,498 consecutive admissions revealed that units achieving higher compliance with these indicators demonstrated 22\% shorter length of stay (median 8 versus 11 days, p<0.001) and improved functional independence scores at discharge.
\textcite{Tracy2023} examined allied health integration specifically, finding that 97\% of burn patients now receive physiotherapy and occupational therapy assessment within 48 hours of admission. This represents dramatic improvement from historical data suggesting only 60\% received allied health input during entire admissions in the 1990s. Early assessment correlated with reduced \gls{contracture} rates (8\% versus 19\% historically, p<0.001) and improved range of motion preservation.

### Functional Recovery and Long-term Outcomes
\textcite{Tracy2025} conducted the first comprehensive feasibility study for centralizing long-term outcome collection across \gls{branz} units. Following 342 burn survivors for two years, they demonstrated that coordinated \gls{mdt} care extending beyond acute admission maintains benefits over time. Patients receiving structured \gls{mdt} follow-up showed superior Burn Specific Health Scale-Brief scores at 24 months compared to those discharged to fragmented community care (mean difference 12.3 points, 95\% \gls{ci} 8.7-15.9).
\textcite{Gabbe2015} established the methodological framework for evaluating long-term \gls{mdt} outcomes, piloting assessment protocols across Victorian burn services. Their work revealed that functional recovery trajectories differ markedly based on \gls{mdt} care coordination quality. Units with formal transition protocols linking acute and community services achieved \gls{rtw} rates of 78\% at 12 months versus 54\% in units without structured handover processes.
\textcite{Tracy2020} examined predictors of chronic pain and itch, demonstrating that early \gls{mdt} pain management protocols significantly influence long-term outcomes. Patients receiving coordinated pain care from admission (including pharmacological, psychological, and physical therapy interventions) reported 40\% lower pain severity scores at 12 months compared to historical cohorts receiving sequential pain management approaches.

### Cultural Safety Considerations
\textcite{Hunter2024} provided crucial evidence about \gls{mdt} care for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children through the Coolamon Study. This prospective cohort of 156 Indigenous children with burns revealed that culturally-adapted \gls{mdt} models incorporating Aboriginal Health Workers achieved dramatically improved outcomes. When Indigenous Health Workers participated as core \gls{mdt} members rather than cultural consultants, length of stay decreased by 2.8 days (95\% \gls{ci} 1.2-4.4) and follow-up attendance improved from 52\% to 84\%.
\textcite{Coombes2020} conducted qualitative research with 18 Indigenous families, revealing how standard \gls{mdt} approaches may inadvertently create barriers through overwhelming information delivery, conflicting communication from multiple team members, and failure to accommodate extended family involvement in decision-making. Families reported that First Nations Health Workers serving as cultural brokers and care coordinators transformed their experience from "frightening and confusing" to "supported and understood."
These studies highlight that effective \gls{mdt} care requires adaptation to cultural contexts rather than universal application of standardized protocols. The evidence suggests that Indigenous patients benefit particularly from \gls{mdt} approaches when \gls{culturalsafety} principles integrate throughout team functioning rather than being addressed as separate considerations.

### Technology-Based MDT Delivery
\textcite{Plaza2022} conducted the first Australasian \gls{rct} examining telerehabilitation within \gls{mdt} frameworks. Forty-five patients with burns affecting less than 25\% \gls{tbsa} were randomized to receive either traditional in-person \gls{mdt} rehabilitation or \gls{telehealth}-delivered therapy with remote \gls{mdt} coordination. The study demonstrated non-inferiority for functional outcomes (Lower Limb Functional Index difference 2.1 points, 95\% \gls{ci} -3.4 to 7.6) while reducing travel burden and improving rural access.
\textcite{Matthew2023} examined \gls{telehealth} implementation across remote Australian communities, demonstrating that technology can extend rather than replace \gls{mdt} coordination. Their mixed-methods evaluation of 89 patients revealed that successful remote \gls{mdt} care requires dedicated coordination roles, reliable technology infrastructure, and hybrid models combining periodic in-person assessment with regular virtual contact.
These technology studies prove particularly relevant given Australia's geographic challenges, with many patients living hundreds of kilometers from specialist \glspl{burnunit}. The evidence suggests that \gls{telehealth} can maintain \gls{mdt} care quality while improving accessibility, though it requires systematic implementation rather than ad hoc adoption.

### Economic Considerations
\textcite{Cleland2022} analyzed the economic burden of severe burns in Victoria, providing crucial context for \gls{mdt} resource allocation. Examining 331 patients with severe burns, they calculated mean acute care costs of \gls{aud} \$289,000 per patient, with considerable variation based on burn severity and complications. While \gls{mdt} care requires greater upfront resource investment (approximately 18\% higher daily costs), total episode costs prove lower through reduced complications and shorter admissions.
\textcite{McPhail2022} conducted formal economic evaluation of \gls{mdt} scar management protocols, demonstrating cost-effectiveness despite intensive resource requirements. Their analysis of 198 patients revealed that coordinated scar care involving therapists, nurses, and medical staff achieved incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of \gls{aud} \$21,000 per \gls{qaly} gained, well below accepted thresholds for healthcare interventions.

## Synthesis Across Studies
Despite the absence of direct comparative trials, multiple evidence streams converge to support \gls{mdt} effectiveness. Registry data demonstrates universal adoption with associated quality improvements. Implementation studies confirm feasibility across diverse settings. Economic analyses validate resource efficiency despite higher daily costs. Diverse population research reveals enhanced benefits when \gls{mdt} models adapt to cultural needs.
The consistency of findings across different study designs, populations, and outcome measures provides robust triangulation supporting \gls{mdt} superiority over historical single-discipline models. While we cannot definitively quantify the magnitude of \gls{mdt} benefits without randomized comparison, the complete absence of units maintaining traditional approaches paradoxically provides the strongest possible endorsement: no Australasian burn service considers single-discipline care acceptable practice.

## Quality Assessment of Evidence
Using Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine criteria, the overall evidence quality supporting \gls{multidisciplinary} burn care rates as Level 2a (systematic reviews of cohort studies with consistent results). While the absence of \glspl{rct} comparing \gls{mdt} to traditional care prevents Level 1 evidence designation, the convergent findings from multiple high-quality observational studies, registry analyses, and the single \gls{rct} examining \gls{telehealth} delivery provide robust support for \gls{mdt} effectiveness.
Methodological strengths include large sample sizes from \gls{branz} registry data, standardized outcome measurement across centers, prospective data collection in several studies, and triangulation across quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Limitations include the inability to establish causation definitively without randomized comparison, potential publication bias favoring positive \gls{mdt} findings, and heterogeneity in \gls{mdt} implementation making precise effect size estimation challenging.
The economic evaluations by \textcite{Cleland2022} and \textcite{McPhail2022} provide Level 2b evidence (individual cohort studies) supporting cost-effectiveness, though comprehensive economic modeling comparing \gls{mdt} to hypothetical single-discipline care remains absent. The qualitative research by \textcite{Coombes2020} adds important context about implementation challenges and cultural considerations that quantitative studies might miss, strengthening the overall evidence synthesis through methodological diversity.

# Discussion

## Clinical Bottom Line
**Strong convergent evidence supports coordinated \gls{multidisciplinary** management as the optimal care standard for acute burn injury in Australasian settings.} While direct comparative studies with traditional single-discipline care are absent due to universal \gls{mdt} adoption, multiple evidence streams consistently demonstrate:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item **Universal implementation validates effectiveness**: All 17 specialist \glspl{burnunit} across Australia and New Zealand have adopted \gls{mdt} models, with no services maintaining traditional single-discipline approaches. This complete paradigm shift represents powerful implicit evidence for \gls{mdt} superiority.
    
    \item **Process indicators demonstrate coordination quality**: 97\% of patients receive allied health assessment within 48 hours , compared to historical rates of 60\% receiving any allied health input. Units with comprehensive \gls{mdt} protocols achieve 22\% shorter length of stay .
    
    \item **Functional outcomes show sustained improvement**: Structured \gls{mdt} follow-up maintains benefits at 24 months post-injury . \Gls{rtw} rates reach 78\% with formal \gls{mdt} transition protocols versus 54\% without .
    
    \item **Cultural safety and health equity improves outcomes**: Indigenous children experience 2.8-day shorter admissions when Aboriginal Health Workers integrate as core \gls{mdt} members . Culturally-adapted \gls{mdt} models improve follow-up attendance from 52\% to 84\%.
    
    \item **Technology successfully extends \gls{mdt** reach}: Telerehabilitation proves non-inferior to in-person \gls{mdt} therapy while improving rural access . Remote communities can access coordinated care through structured \gls{telehealth} programs .
    
    \item **Economic evaluation supports resource allocation**: Despite 18\% higher daily costs, \gls{mdt} care reduces total episode expenses through fewer complications and shorter admissions . Scar management protocols achieve cost-effectiveness at \gls{aud} \$21,000 per \gls{qaly} gained .
\end{enumerate}

## Implications for Practice

### Immediate Implementation Priorities
\Glspl{burnunit} seeking to optimize \gls{multidisciplinary} care should focus on three foundational elements supported by the evidence. First, establish daily structured team rounds using standardized communication frameworks. \textcite{Gong2021} demonstrated that even basic coordination protocols significantly improve outcomes compared to informal communication patterns. Second, ensure allied health assessment within 48 hours of admission, as delays correlate with poorer functional outcomes and increased complications. Third, develop unified documentation systems that enable real-time information sharing between disciplines, reducing communication errors and treatment delays.
The evidence particularly emphasizes early integration rather than sequential consultation. Physiotherapists and occupational therapists should participate in surgical planning from admission rather than commencing therapy after wound closure. Dietitians should establish nutrition protocols immediately rather than responding to developing malnutrition. Psychologists should engage during acute care rather than addressing established \gls{ptsd}.

### Institutional Requirements
Implementing effective \gls{mdt} care demands institutional commitment beyond good intentions. Protected time for team meetings proves essential, with successful units allocating minimum 30 minutes daily for structured rounds. Physical spaces that support collaboration, such as conference rooms adjacent to \glspl{burnunit}, facilitate regular team interaction. Electronic health records must enable simultaneous documentation and review by multiple disciplines rather than siloed systems requiring duplicate data entry.
Resource calculations from \textcite{Cleland2022} indicate that a 20-bed \gls{burnunit} requires approximately 2.0 additional full-time equivalent positions across allied health disciplines to support comprehensive \gls{mdt} care compared to traditional models. However, economic analysis confirms return on investment through reduced complications, shorter admissions, and improved long-term outcomes.

### Cultural Safety and Equity
The evidence from \textcite{Hunter2024} and \textcite{Coombes2020} demands systematic attention to \gls{culturalsafety} within \gls{mdt} frameworks. Indigenous Health Workers should participate as core team members rather than occasional cultural consultants. Communication protocols must accommodate extended family involvement in decision-making for Indigenous patients. Information delivery requires adaptation to avoid overwhelming families with multiple team members providing fragmented messages.
These principles extend beyond Indigenous populations to all culturally and linguistically diverse communities. Effective \gls{mdt} care requires cultural humility, recognizing that coordination approaches successful in mainstream populations may create barriers for minority groups. Regular cultural competency training for all team members, employment of bicultural workers, and systematic evaluation of equity outcomes prove essential.

### Technology Integration
Rural and remote burn care can achieve quality comparable to metropolitan centers through systematic \gls{telehealth} integration. \textcite{Plaza2022} and \textcite{Matthew2023} demonstrate that success requires dedicated coordination roles, reliable technology infrastructure, and hybrid models combining virtual and in-person contact. Investment in high-quality videoconferencing equipment, staff training in virtual consultation skills, and protocols for remote assessment prove essential.
\Gls{telehealth} should supplement rather than replace face-to-face \gls{mdt} coordination for complex cases. The evidence suggests optimal models involve initial in-person assessment when possible, regular virtual team rounds including remote providers, and structured handover processes when patients transfer between virtual and physical care settings.

## Future Directions

### Research Priorities
The absence of comparative studies creates clear research imperatives. While randomizing patients to receive suboptimal care raises ethical concerns, natural experiments may arise when resource constraints force temporary \gls{mdt} service reductions. Prospective data collection during such periods could provide comparative evidence currently lacking.
Implementation science methodologies could reveal how to optimize existing \gls{mdt} models rather than whether to adopt them. Questions requiring investigation include optimal team composition for different burn severities, meeting frequency and structure for maximum effectiveness, and coordination approaches that balance comprehensiveness with efficiency.
Long-term outcome research beyond two years remains limited. Understanding how \gls{mdt} care during acute admission influences outcomes at five and ten years could justify increased resource investment. Particular attention to \gls{qol}, community participation, and psychological adjustment would complement existing functional and economic data.

### System-Level Changes
The evidence supports policy mandating minimum \gls{mdt} standards for designated burn centers. \Gls{branz} quality indicators provide framework for measurement, but formal accreditation requirements could ensure consistent implementation. Funding models must recognize coordination costs while capturing downstream savings through prevented complications and readmissions.
Medical and nursing education should incorporate \gls{mdt} competencies as core curriculum rather than optional content. Training programs should emphasize communication skills, team dynamics, and systems thinking alongside traditional clinical knowledge. Simulation-based education could prepare health professionals for complex team coordination before entering clinical practice.

## Study Limitations
This critically appraised topic has several limitations. The search was restricted to Australasian studies, potentially missing relevant international evidence. The heterogeneity of \gls{multidisciplinary} definitions across studies limits direct comparison. Publication bias may favor positive findings about team-based care. Finally, the focus on specialist burn centers may limit applicability to smaller or rural facilities with different resource constraints.
Despite these limitations, the evidence synthesis provides robust support for \gls{mdt} implementation as the standard of care for acute burn injury. The consistency of findings across diverse methodologies, populations, and outcome measures strengthens confidence in the conclusions despite the absence of direct comparative trials.

# Conclusion
This critical appraisal reveals a striking reality: coordinated \gls{multidisciplinary} management has achieved such complete acceptance in Australasian burn care that traditional single-discipline comparators no longer exist. While this prevents definitive quantification of \gls{mdt} benefits through randomized trials, the universal adoption itself provides powerful validation. No burn service anywhere in Australia or New Zealand considers returning to surgeon-led sequential consultation models acceptable practice.
The construction worker in our opening scenario would today receive immediate coordinated attention from multiple specialists working as an integrated team. His burn wounds would heal with surgical expertise while physiotherapists preserve his range of motion, dietitians prevent malnutrition, psychologists address traumatic stress, and social workers prepare his family for the recovery journey. This coordinated approach, supported by convergent evidence from registry analyses, implementation studies, and economic evaluations, optimizes his chances for returning to meaningful work and life participation.
The evidence illuminates clear paths forward. Units should implement structured communication protocols, ensure early allied health integration, and adapt coordination approaches for \gls{culturalsafety}. Technology can extend \gls{mdt} benefits to remote communities without compromising quality. Economic investment in coordination resources returns value through improved outcomes and reduced complications.
Most significantly, the Australasian experience demonstrates that complex healthcare challenges demand complex solutions. No single discipline possesses all expertise necessary for optimal burn outcomes. When healthcare professionals truly collaborate through structured protocols, shared decision-making, and unified goals, patient outcomes improve across every measured domain. The question is no longer whether to implement \gls{mdt} care but how to optimize its delivery for every burn patient regardless of location, background, or circumstance.
The implications extend beyond burn care to other complex medical conditions requiring integrated expertise. As healthcare becomes increasingly specialized, the coordination challenge intensifies. The success of \gls{multidisciplinary} burn care provides a blueprint for team-based approaches in trauma, critical care, rehabilitation, and chronic disease management. \textcite{Gong2021}'s quality indicators could be adapted for other conditions, while the implementation strategies documented by \textcite{Hunter2024} for Indigenous populations offer models for addressing health equity across all medical specialties.
\clearpage
For the 6,000-7,000 Australians and New Zealanders who suffer burn injuries annually, this evidence offers hope. Not just for survival, but for recovery that restores function, preserves dignity, and returns them to meaningful lives. The 42-year-old construction worker represents thousands of individuals whose outcomes depend on healthcare systems recognizing that excellence emerges not from individual brilliance but from coordinated expertise working toward shared goals.
The \gls{branz} registry continues documenting outcomes, providing ongoing validation of \gls{mdt} effectiveness while identifying opportunities for improvement. As \textcite{Tracy2025} demonstrated, the benefits of coordinated care extend far beyond hospital discharge, influencing recovery trajectories for years. This long-term perspective reinforces the importance of viewing burn care not as an acute episode but as a continuum requiring sustained coordination across settings and time.
In an era of technological advances and specialized treatments, perhaps the most powerful intervention remains the coordinated effort of disciplines working together toward a common goal; the best possible outcome for every patient. The evidence from Australasian \glspl{burnunit} demonstrates that when we move beyond professional silos to embrace true collaboration, we achieve outcomes that no single discipline could accomplish alone.
The evidence is clear. The implementation challenge remains. The opportunity to transform burn care, and healthcare more broadly, awaits those committed to collaborative excellence in patient care.
