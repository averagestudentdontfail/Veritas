    \guideinfo{It is good academic practice to briefly state how, why, and when AI was used. Explaining both the actions taken and the reasons behind them encourages critical reflection, deepens understanding of AI's role in learning, and supports the evaluation of its impact on your work's quality and integrity. This page can be removed by setting the option \texttt{aiack} to \texttt{false} in the document class options.}

    \prompt[1]{In a paragraph, simply describe what LaTeX is.}
    
    \aioutput[1]{LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system commonly used for producing scientific and mathematical documents due to its powerful handling of formulas and bibliographies. Unlike word processors, it uses plain text files with markup tags to define the structure and formatting of a document, allowing precise control over layout and appearance. It is especially popular in academia and research for creating theses, journal articles, and presentations.}
