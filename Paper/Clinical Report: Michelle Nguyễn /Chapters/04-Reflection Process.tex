\section{Clinical Strengths}

Rapport was successfully established despite Michelle's initial reluctance. Opening with acknowledgment of her inexperience with psychology and clear confidentiality explanation helped reduce resistance. Cultural sensitivity was demonstrated through non-pathologizing exploration of family dynamics, recognizing acculturation tensions rather than dysfunction.

\section{Areas for Development}

Michelle's strengths at work warranted deeper exploration for intervention planning. Protective factors including friendship dynamics and family cultural strengths required more systematic assessment. Michelle's readiness for change and specific goals beyond being "heard" needed further exploration. The assessment would benefit from more balanced exploration of her Vietnamese-Australian identity, including sources of pride alongside conflicts.
